# **py-filename-format**
A simple Python program which automatizes a dull process of renaming files to a certain standard.
## How to use it?
1. Download `filenamedraft.py` and `functions.py` (make sure that you have them in the same folder)
2. Move the files that you want to rename to the program's folder (PF)
3. Run `filenamedraft.py`. You should see a list of all the files that you moved to the PF
4. Choose 1 of 2 functions:
    - **Same name - different number**, which will give a specified name to all the files **and** n+1 number at the end of the name (instead of `20190304_162004.jpeg`, `20190304_162015.jpeg` etc. you can have `thailand1.jpeg`, `thailand2.jpeg` and so on)
    - **Prefix or postfix**, which allows you to add something at the begining or at the end of the PF's filenames (instead of `thailand1.jpeg`, `thailand2.jpeg` etc. you can hace `thailand1_Bangkok.jpeg`, `thailand2_Bangkok.jpeg` and so on)
5. Follow the instructions (well, just type the new name or prefix/postfix);
6. Live a happy life with freshly renamed files :star:
